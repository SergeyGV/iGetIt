Ever wondered how much the class truly understands in the middle of a lecture?

This website helps you answer that question.

# Features

Enroll as an instructor, and make your own classes along with a code. Then, provide your students the code, start the lecture, and prompt students to vote if they undestand or they don't!

Students can't double vote until you clear the votes, so not only can the tally not be tampered with, but it also gives you better control as to when you want students to vote.

# Personal set up

Coming soon! Currently only can be set up by uoft students within a certain class.
